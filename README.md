Object oriented Approach to Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis has become important today especially with the kind of insights it provides to make Business decisions. While there are state-of-the-art techniques to Analyse the sentiment using Deep Learning/ Machine Learning techniques, I by no means argue that this approach is better than the existing approaches of Natural Language Processing. 

Most of the Sentiment Analysis is done using popular Data Analysis libraries in Python like Numpy. As Java falls short of such libraries, I used a traditional Object Oriented Design Approach combined with simple Data Structures to carry out Sentiment Analysis.
